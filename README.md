# ColorList

MADE IN REACT NATIVE

It's an app that saves and displays colors you have submitted in a list. Once submitted a button referencing that color will appear,
and you will be able to click on the button to view information on that specific color such as RGB, HEX, and HSL. There is also an option to go to a webpage in app to view more colors, just in case you ran out of colors to think of :)
